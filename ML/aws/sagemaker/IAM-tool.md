AWS provides several tools to quickly find roles and policies. Here are a few:

AWS IAM Policy Simulator: The IAM Policy Simulator allows you to simulate the effects of IAM policies on specific AWS resources. You can use this tool to determine which policies are attached to which roles, and to test whether a particular policy grants the permissions you expect.

AWS IAM Access Analyzer: IAM Access Analyzer analyzes your AWS resources, such as Amazon S3 buckets and AWS KMS keys, and generates findings to help you identify resources that are publicly accessible or granted access to external principals. It can also help you identify which roles and policies are granting unintended permissions.

AWS CLI: The AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) allows you to interact with AWS services from the command line. You can use commands such as "aws iam get-role" and "aws iam list-attached-role-policies" to quickly find information about roles and their associated policies.

AWS Console: The AWS Management Console provides a graphical user interface that you can use to manage your AWS resources. You can use the console to view and manage IAM roles and policies, and to search for specific roles or policies using the search bar.

By using these tools, you can quickly find roles and policies within your AWS environment, and ensure that your resources are properly secured.
