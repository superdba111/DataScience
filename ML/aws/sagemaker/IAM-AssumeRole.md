In AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), there are two types of roles - normal roles and assume roles.

A normal IAM role is a set of permissions that can be assumed by an AWS service or an authenticated user to perform tasks on your behalf. This means that users or services that are already authenticated with AWS can assume the role and inherit the permissions associated with that role.

On the other hand, an IAM assume role is a way to delegate access to AWS resources to users, applications, or services that are not part of your AWS account. Assume roles are often used in scenarios where an external user or service requires access to resources in your AWS account, but you do not want to provide them with permanent access keys.

To assume an IAM role, a user or application must first obtain temporary security credentials, such as access key and secret access key, from the AWS Security Token Service (STS). These credentials are provided to the user or application after they have successfully authenticated with AWS and assume the role.

In summary, normal IAM roles are used to delegate access to users and services within your AWS account, while assume roles are used to delegate access to external users and services. You should use assume roles when you need to grant temporary access to AWS resources to external entities without creating long-term IAM users or credentials.
